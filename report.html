                    <p>
                        <p>In determening what kind of design we wanted for our website we looked to the
                        sites that have been made in the labs, as well as elvebredden caf√©. We did not
                        make use of drawing up a sitemap and/or sketching the different pages with pen 
                        and paper, but that is probably something we want to do for our future websites because
                        it gives you something tangible to work with.</p>

                        <p>When we first looked at what accessibility means for a website, we thought
                        about what different obstacles people can have when it comes to reading on 
                        a website. We looked at Elvebredden Cafe's website and initially thought that it
                        looked relatively pleasant, however, when we tried navigating the site using
                        only the keyboard we found that navigation was severly limited. It was only
                        possible to scroll up and down with the arrow keys, pressing tab did not
                        cycle between the menu buttons. For people with impaired vision, using a 
                        computer mouse is often not possible which means they are reliant on websites
                        supporting use of the keyboard. We made sure to make this possible on our website
                        as we do not want to lose a potential 130,000 customers (which is the amount of
                        legally blind people in Norway).</p>

                        <p>Another form of visual impairment is color
                        blindness, the most common form of which entails a difficulty in distinguishing
                        between red and green. Therefore, we wanted to avoid these color combinations on 
                        our website so that it is accessible also for color blind people.</p>

                        <p>When it comes to fonts, we chose to use Arial for all the text on our website. 
                        This is because arial is a sans-serif font which means that it does not have serifs. 
                        Serifs are decorative line strokes attached to the end of the "main" lines 
                        of a letter. No serifs means less clutter in words which may be beneficial for 
                        dyslexics using our page.</p>

                        <p>After creating a website design we were pleased with, 
                        we sent the pages constituting the complete website through the web accessibility checker
                        "Achecker". This tool read the html code of your website and finds elements that
                        may have an impact on the site's accessibility. Lucky for us, we did not have a whole
                        lot of things that had to be changed, but there were a few. Firstly we had completely forgotten 
                        to set the website lang attribute. This ties in to accessibility because without
                        setting the language, screen readers (assistive software used by visually impaired people)
                        may not have the right pronounciation. The other accessibility problem Achecker
                        notified us of, was that we had an id that was not unique; our header had the id "header".</p>
